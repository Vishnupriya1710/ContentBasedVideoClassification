```
## Model Training
The model training process involves:
* Preprocessing videos to extract frames.
* Extracting features from frames using OpenCV.
* Training a machine learning model using the extracted features.
* Evaluating the model on a validation set.

## Evaluation
Model evaluation is performed using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
